<h1 align="center">Pokedex API</h1>
<br/>
<h3 align="center">Api created in Android Studio using Java that brings data from https://pokeapi.co/</h3>
<br/>
**Updated** version of https://github.com/ricardobar96/pokedex-api-old, where I modified the Api to return only **the first 151 pokemon** (first generation), cleared the layout to display only **one pokemon per row** and changed its **visual appearance**, bringing new functionalities in the form of **menu items** and the possibility to access to a **specific pokemon** view by clicking on it. **Enrique** helped me by migrating the app to **Kotlin**,  changing with me **the appearance** of the app and **cleaning** the code.
